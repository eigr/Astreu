     * This method is used to receive messages that have been produced for a given topic.
     *  An exchange of typical messages for a consumer to connect to the broker and receive messages should be as follows:
     *      1. The customer starts by sending a message of type System that contains an internal message of type Connect, 
     *         which in turn indicates all the desired settings through their attributes (see Connect and System).
     *      2. The client is waiting for messages from the server.
     *      3. The server validates whether the client can connect and, if so, starts forwarding messages that are produced to the topic of interest. 
     *         If not, a System message containing an internal Failure message will be sent by the server 
     *         to the client informing the reason for the failure (see Failure and System).
     *      4. For each message received, the client must send a Messgae message containing the Ack confirming or rejecting the message.
